🚀 An end-to-end Machine Learning project that predicts employee performance and provides actionable HR insights using a production-ready pipeline and interactive dashboard.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world HR analytics system where employee data is used to:

✔ Predict performance (Low / Medium / High)  
✔ Provide intelligent HR recommendations  
✔ Assist in promotion and training decisions  

The system is built using a fully pipeline-based approach to avoid data leakage and ensure scalability.

## ⚙️ Key Features

### 🔹 Machine Learning
- RandomForestClassifier with `class_weight='balanced'`
- Stratified Train-Test Split
- End-to-end Pipeline (no manual preprocessing)

### 🔹 Data Processing
- ColumnTransformer
- Numeric:
  - Missing value imputation (median)
  - Feature scaling (StandardScaler)
- Categorical:
  - Missing value handling
  - OneHotEncoding

### 🔹 Model Evaluation
- Accuracy Score
- Classification Report
- Confusion Matrix (heatmap visualization)

### 🔹 HR Insights Engine
- Low → Training & mentoring recommended  
- Medium → Skill improvement plan suggested  
- High → Promotion-ready candidate  

### 🔹 Interactive Dashboard
- Built using Streamlit  
- User inputs employee details  
- Real-time prediction + insights
